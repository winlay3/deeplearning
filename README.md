CNN Deep Learning Project
Overview

This repository contains learning experiments with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) using TensorFlow and PyTorch. It includes multiple files demonstrating CNN architectures, training, and evaluation on sample datasets.

The goal of this project is to practice and understand the basics of CNNs, deep learning workflows, and framework-specific implementations.
